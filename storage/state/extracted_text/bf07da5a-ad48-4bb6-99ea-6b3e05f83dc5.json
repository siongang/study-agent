    " \n \n \nMidterm Examination 1: Topics and Concepts \nDate: February 24, 2026 \nCoverage: Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 \nThis midterm covers the foundational principles of Systems Dynamics (SD), focusing \non qualitative analysis, modelling perspectives, and the core structural tools: Causal \nLoop Diagrams (CLDs) and Stock and Flow (S&F) structures, and the resulting basic \ndynamic behaviours. \nChapter 1: SD Fundamentals & Perspective \n• Policy Resistance: Understanding why well-intentioned interventions in \ncomplex systems often fail or produce counterintuitive side effects. \n• Feedback and Learning: The distinction between single-loop learning \n(adjusting decisions based on outcomes) and double-loop learning (revising \nmental models and system structure). \n• Barriers to Learning: Dynamic complexity, limited information, time delays, \nflawed cognitive maps, and attribution error (blaming the person, not the \nsystem). \n• SD Worldview: Understanding systems as tightly coupled, governed by \nfeedback, nonlinear, and history-dependent. \nChapter 2 & 3: The Modelling Process \n• Purpose of Modelling: Solving a problem (improving performance and \npolicies), not merely modelling an entire system. \n• Modelling Steps (Iterative Process): \n1. Problem Articulation (defining boundaries, time horizon, and key \nvariables). \n2. Formulating a Dynamic Hypothesis (endogenous explanation of \nbehaviour). \n3. Formulating a Simulation Model. \n4. Testing (assessing suitability and robustness). \n5. Policy Design and Evaluation. \n• Reference Modes: Generating and interpreting historical and projected \npatterns of behaviour over time (e.g., exponential growth, oscillations). \n• Endogenous vs. Exogenous: The crucial importance of making factors \nresponsible for the problem dynamics internal (endogenous) to the model \nboundary. \n",
    " \n \n \nChapter 4: Structure and Behaviour of Dynamic Systems \n• The Link between Structure and Behaviour: The principle that a system's \nbehaviour arises entirely from its internal feedback structure. \n• Fundamental Modes: \n• Exponential Growth: Generated by positive (self-reinforcing) \nfeedback loops (R). \n• Goal Seeking: Generated by negative (self-correcting/balancing) \nfeedback loops (B). \n• Oscillation: Generated by negative feedback loops containing \nsignificant time delays. \n• Complex Modes: S-Shaped Growth, Overshoot and Collapse (arising from \nnon-linear interactions of fundamental modes). \nChapter 5: Causal Loop Diagrams (CLDs) \n• Notation: Representing variables, causal links (arrows), and polarity signs (+ \nand -). \n• Polarity Determination: The rules for assigning link polarity (ceteris paribus \nassumption) and loop polarity (counting negative links). \n• Causation vs. Correlation: Ensuring links represent genuine causal \npathways. \n• CLD Guidelines: Importance of naming loops, indicating delays, and avoiding \ndiagrams that are too large or complex for effective communication. \nChapter 6: Stocks and Flows (S&F) \n• Conceptual Definition: Stocks (accumulations, inertia, memory) decouple \ninflow and outflow rates, generating disequilibrium. Flows (rates) change the \nsize of the stock. \n• S&F Notation: Using rectangles (stocks), thick arrows/pipes (flows), valves \n(rates), and clouds (sources/sinks). \n• Dimensional Consistency: Understanding how units confirm whether a \nvariable is a stock (units) or a flow (units/time). \n• The Snapshot Test: Identifying true stocks in a system. \n• Conservation of Material: Understanding which flows are conserved \n(material/people) versus non-conserved (information). \n• Model Boundaries (Challenging the Clouds): Recognizing that external \nclouds imply infinite source/sink capacity and zero feedback from boundary \ncomponents. \n",
    " \n \n \nChapter 7: Dynamics of Stocks and Flows \n• Integration and Differentiation: Understanding the relationship between \nstocks (integration of net flows) and flows (differentiation of stocks). \n• Graphical Integration: The ability to sketch a stock's behaviour given the net \nflow rate over time (Area under the curve = Change in Stock). \n• Graphical Differentiation: The ability to sketch the net flow rate given the \nstock's trajectory (Slope of the curve = Net Flow Rate). \n• Delays: Understanding that all delays necessarily contain at least one stock \n(e.g., material in transit, perceived conditions). \nChapter 8: Closing the Loop: Dynamics of Simple Structures (First-\nOrder Systems) \n• Order of System: Defined by the number of independent stocks. \n• Linear Positive Feedback: Generating pure exponential growth (e.g., \ninterest compounding). Calculation of the Doubling Time (Rule of 70). \n• Linear Negative Feedback: Generating pure exponential decay (goal \nseeking). Calculation of the Half-Life or Adjustment Time. \n• Phase Plots (First-Order): Analyzing the plot of Net Inflow Rate vs. Stock to \ndetermine equilibrium points (where rate = 0) and their stability (slope). \n• Nonlinear First-Order Systems (S-Shaped Growth): The mechanism by \nwhich loop dominance shifts from positive to negative feedback as the stock \napproaches carrying capacity, causing the growth rate to slow to zero. \n• Oscillation Constraint: Understanding why first-order systems cannot \noscillate (oscillation requires at least two independent stocks, often \nrepresented by time delays). \n"
