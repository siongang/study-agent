    " \n \n \nSYSD 300: Introduction to Optimization \nWinter 2026 Course Outline \nCourse description. Suppose that the owner of a factory wants to maximize its \nproduction for the next 30 days. There is a limit on the resources available. \nResources may include raw materials, labour, machine capacities, etc. This is an \nexample of an optimization problem. We can describe the amount of production \nusing a function. This is the function that we want to maximize, and it is called the \nobjective function. The conditions imposed by the available resources are the \nconstraints of the problem. \nThis course will discuss optimization problems where the objective function and the \nconstraints are linear. We plan to cover the following topics, integrating these \noptimization principles with the foundational modelling tools of System Dynamics \n(SD): \n1. Formulating and modelling real world problems as linear programs. \n2. The simplex algorithm for solving linear programs. \n3. Some theory behind the algorithm, including geometry and duality. \n4. Strategies in solving integer programs. \n5.
