    " \n \n \nPHYS 234: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics \nWinter 2026 Course Outline \nCourse Description \nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to the fundamentals of quantum \nmechanics, focusing on the core principles and mathematical formalism necessary to \nanalyze modern physical systems. Based on Quantum Mechanics: A Paradigms \nApproach by David H. McIntyre, we will begin with the inherently quantum nature of \nspin systems before transitioning to wave mechanics and the rigorous analysis of \ncanonical problems, including the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom. The \ncourse culminates in an introduction to advanced topics such as perturbation theory \nand the behaviour of identical particles. \nPrerequisites: Familiarity with linear algebra and intermediate modern physics is \nassumed. \nTextbook \n• Quantum Mechanics: A Paradigms Approach by David H.
