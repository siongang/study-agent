    " \n \n \nHLTH 204: Biostatistics for Biological \nand Health Sciences \nWinter 2026 Course Outline \nCourse description. Statistics permeates nearly every aspect of our lives, and its \nrole is particularly important in the biological, life, medical, and health sciences. This \ncourse forges the relationship between statistics and our world through extensive \nuse of real applications that bring life to theory and methods. We will focus on the \nanalysis of real data sets including biometric security, body measurements, and \nclinical trials to understand the behaviour of populations. \nThis course will cover the essential methods of descriptive and inferential statistics. \nWe plan to cover the following topics: \n1. Summarizing and visualizing data with tables, graphs, and descriptive \nstatistics. \n2. Probability theory, including discrete, binomial, and normal distributions. \n3. Estimating population parameters and determining necessary sample sizes. \n4. Conducting formal hypothesis tests for one and two samples. \n5. Specialized modelling including Correlation, Regression, ANOVA, and \nSurvival Analysis. \nSchedule \nThere are 14 chapters in the textbook to be covered across 12 weeks of instruction. \nWeek \nDate \nSchedule \nAssignment \nDeadline \n1 \nJan 8 \nIntroduction to Statistics (Ch. 1) & \nExploring Data (Ch. 2) \nJan 17 \n2 \nJan 15 \nDescribing, Exploring, and Comparing \nData (Ch. 3) \nJan 24 \n3 \nJan 22 \nProbability: Rules, Bayes’ Theorem, Risks \nand Odds (Ch. 4) \nJan 31 \n4 \nJan 29 \nDiscrete Probability Distributions: Binomial \n& Poisson (Ch. 5) \nFeb 7 \n5 \nFeb 5 \nNormal Probability Distributions (Ch. 6) \nFeb 14 \n6 \nFeb 12 \nNo new material - Midterm Review / \nCatch up time \nn.a. \n",
